# 💘 Ishqrisk – A Blind Date Experience for Valentine’s Day @ Fortitude MEC

Ishqrisk is a **Valentine’s Day–exclusive blind date application** built for **Fortitude MEC**.  
It is designed to help students explore connections in a fun, low-pressure way — **without creating awkwardness or discomfort afterward**.

This platform ensures that identities are revealed **only when both users mutually agree**.

##  The Problem

Valentine’s Day brings curiosity, excitement, and sometimes hesitation.

In a college environment:
- Rejection can feel awkward
- Mismatches can lead to uncomfortable encounters later
- Many students avoid trying at all because of social pressure

Ishqrisk removes that fear.

---

##  The Solution

A **safe, anonymous blind date flow** where:
- Conversations come before identities
- Consent is mandatory on both sides
- Walking away has **zero consequences**

If there’s a spark — continue.  
If not — part ways gracefully.

---

##  How It Works

###  Authentication
- Every user must be authenticated before entering the platform.
- Ensures genuine participation during the Valentine’s Day event.

---

###  Interests & Preferences
- Users submit:
  - **Interests** → used for matching
  - **Preferences** → used to finalize compatibility
- Matches are meaningful, not random.

---

###  Waiting Area
- Users enter a **waiting area** while the system finds a compatible match.

---

###  Match Found
- Once matched, both users move to a shared interaction space.

---

###  Anonymous Timed Chat (Blind Phase)
- Users chat for a **limited time**.
- During this phase:
  - Only a **nickname** is visible
  - **Profiles remain hidden**
  - **No personal information** is allowed

This ensures unbiased and pressure-free interaction.

---

###  Mutual Decision
- After the chat timer ends, both users choose:
  - **YES** – continue
  - **NO** – exit

#### Result:
- 💞 **Both YES** → Profiles are revealed
- 🌫️ **Either NO** → Match ends silently

No awkwardness.  
No forced explanations.  
No real-life discomfort.

---

##  Why There’s No Awkwardness

- Anonymous first interaction
- Mutual consent required
- No visibility unless both agree
- Clean exit if interest is not mutual

Designed so that even if users meet later on campus, nothing feels uncomfortable.
